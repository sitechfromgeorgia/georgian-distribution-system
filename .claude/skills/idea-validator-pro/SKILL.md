# Idea Validator Pro

## Purpose

This skill helps you rapidly and objectively assess product ideas before investing time and resources in development. It prevents months of wasted effort on ideas that lack real market demand.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- You have a new SaaS or product idea and want to assess its potential
- You're uncertain if an idea is worth pursuing
- You need objective, data-driven evaluation before committing resources
- You want to understand your idea's strengths and weaknesses
- You need specific recommendations to improve an idea
- You're deciding between multiple ideas and need comparison

## Validation Process

### Phase 1: Discovery & Research

**ALWAYS start with comprehensive research before making any judgments.**

#### 1. Market Research
Investigate:
- Existing competitors and their solutions
- Market size and growth trends
- Target audience and their pain points
- Pricing models in the market
- Market maturity (emerging vs. saturated)

**Key Questions:**
- Who are the top 5-10 competitors?
- What do they do well? What gaps exist?
- How big is the addressable market?
- Is the market growing, stable, or declining?

#### 2. Demand Verification
Check for real demand signals:
- Search Reddit, Twitter/X, Indie Hackers for discussions
- Analyze Google Trends for search volume
- Look for complaints about existing solutions
- Identify workarounds people currently use
- Check Product Hunt, Hacker News for similar launches

**Evidence to Find:**
- Are people actively searching for solutions?
- Do existing products have waiting lists?
- Are there recurring complaints in communities?
- What alternative solutions are people cobbling together?

#### 3. Technical Assessment
Evaluate build complexity:
- Required features for MVP
- Technical implementation complexity
- Available tools/services to accelerate development
- Realistic time estimate for solo developer
- Required technical skills

**Considerations:**
- Can this be built in 2-4 weeks by one person?
- Are there existing APIs/services to leverage?
- What's the minimum viable feature set?
- What technical risks exist?

#### 4. Monetization Analysis
Assess revenue potential:
- How existing competitors monetize
- Willingness to pay (WTP) evidence
- Average revenue per user (ARPU) in market
- Viable pricing models (subscription, one-time, freemium)
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) indicators

**Key Metrics:**
- What are competitors charging?
- What's the typical ARPU in this space?
- Is there evidence people pay for this?
- What's the realistic revenue potential?

### Phase 2: Scoring Framework

Evaluate ideas using 5 criteria (10 points each, 50 total):

#### 1. Market Crowdedness (10 points)
- **1-3 points**: Extremely crowded, high competition
- **4-6 points**: Moderate competition, differentiation opportunities exist
- **7-10 points**: Less crowded, new opportunities or underserved niches

**Scoring Factors:**
- Number of direct competitors
- Similarity of their value propositions
- Entry barriers
- Availability of unaddressed niches

#### 2. Real Demand (10 points)
- **1-3 points**: Weak or questionable demand signals
- **4-6 points**: Moderate demand, needs additional validation
- **7-10 points**: Strong, verified demand with clear evidence

**Scoring Factors:**
- People actively seeking solutions (not just talking about it)
- Evidence of payment willingness
- Frequency of the problem
- Existence of workarounds (signals real need)

#### 3. Solo Builder Feasibility (10 points)
- **1-3 points**: Very complex, requires large team or deep expertise
- **4-6 points**: Possible but challenging, 4-6 weeks
- **7-10 points**: Fully achievable by solo developer in 2-4 weeks

**Scoring Factors:**
- Essential features for MVP
- Technical complexity
- Availability of existing tools/services
- Realistic time estimate

#### 4. Monetization Potential (10 points)
- **1-3 points**: Weak monetization path, unclear WTP
- **4-6 points**: Possible but not guaranteed
- **7-10 points**: Clear monetization strategy, verified WTP

**Scoring Factors:**
- Evidence of payment for similar products
- Average ARPU in the market
- Viable pricing models
- Realistic revenue expectations

#### 5. Interest Factor (10 points)
- **1-3 points**: Generic, boring problem
- **4-6 points**: Moderately interesting
- **7-10 points**: Exciting, compelling opportunity

**Scoring Factors:**
- Personal excitement about solving this for 6+ months
- Emotional connection to the problem
- Uniqueness or innovation of approach
- Story-telling and marketing potential

### Phase 3: Final Verdict

Based on total score (0-50):

#### 🚀 BUILD IT (35-50 points)
High-priority idea with strong potential across multiple dimensions.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create detailed MVP specification
2. Set 2-4 week build timeline
3. Identify 10-20 target users for early feedback
4. Plan validation strategy (landing page, early access)

#### 🤔 MAYBE (25-34 points)
Promising potential but needs improvement or additional validation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Address identified weaknesses
2. Conduct additional validation (interviews, surveys)
3. Consider pivoting specific aspects
4. Re-evaluate after improvements

#### ⛔ SKIP IT (0-24 points)
High risk with fundamental issues. Find a better opportunity.

**Next Steps:**
1. Document learnings from this idea
2. Identify what attracted you to it
3. Use insights to generate alternative ideas
4. Move on without regret

## Best Practices

### Research Phase
- **Be thorough**: Spend at least 30 minutes on research
- **Use multiple sources**: Don't rely on single data point
- **Look for patterns**: Recurring complaints signal real problems
- **Check financials**: Look at actual revenue data when available
- **Verify claims**: Don't trust marketing material alone

### Scoring Phase
- **Be honest**: Don't inflate scores based on personal bias
- **Use evidence**: Base scores on data, not assumptions
- **Compare fairly**: Benchmark against successful similar products
- **Consider constraints**: Factor in solo builder realities
- **Think long-term**: Is this sustainable beyond initial launch?

### Recommendation Phase
- **Be specific**: Vague advice like "improve marketing" doesn't help
- **Prioritize impact**: Focus on highest-leverage improvements
- **Be realistic**: Don't recommend 6-month pivots
- **Provide alternatives**: If idea is weak, suggest related angles
- **Be encouraging**: But honest about fundamental issues

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't Do:
- **Confirmation bias**: Don't look only for evidence supporting the idea
- **Ignore red flags**: Address serious concerns directly
- **Surface-level research**: "10 competitors exist" isn't enough
- **Vague scoring**: Every score needs specific justification
- **Generic recommendations**: "Do more market research" isn't actionable

### Do This Instead:
- **Seek disconfirming evidence**: Look for reasons why it might fail
- **Name concerns clearly**: Be explicit about problems
- **Deep competitive analysis**: Understand why competitors succeed/fail
- **Evidence-based scoring**: Link each score to specific findings
- **Actionable specifics**: "Interview 10 target users about X problem"
